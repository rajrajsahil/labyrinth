                  This game can become dangerously addictive.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The game play involves getting to the next level by any means necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                  This may involve entering the answer in the text box, changing the URL in the address bar or clicking on various objects on the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At most times, you may have to blackmail/threaten/beg other people for the answer to next level. We do not have anything against that.
                </li>

                  Answers are not case or space sensitive.

                  Usually, the clues for each level can be found in:
                      <ol type="i">
                        <li>Page Title</li>
                        <li>URL</li>
                        <li>Pictures on the level</li>
                        <li>Page source. Use View -> Page Source</li>
                        <li>Some amount of binary (.doc, .jpg etc.) download/manipulation may be required to get the hint to next level.</li>
                      </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                  As we are evil, we may like to distract, deviate or confuse you once in a while.
                </li>
                <li>
                  May the force be with you.
                </li>
